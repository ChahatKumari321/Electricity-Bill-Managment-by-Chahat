# Electricity-Bill-Managment-by-Chahat
In this repository i have made Electricity bill managment System using Java GUI
**Project Overview**

The Electricity Bill Management System is a Java-based desktop application developed using Java Swing. It is designed to manage electricity customer records and calculate bills efficiently. The system allows users to add, update, search, and sort customer data through a simple graphical interface.
**Objectives of the Project**

The main objective of this project is to apply Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures concepts in a real-world application. It helps students understand GUI development, linked lists, sorting algorithms, and searching techniques using Java.
**Features of the System**

The system allows users to add new customers with ID, name, and units consumed.
Users can update electricity units of existing customers.
Customers can be searched by ID or name.
Customer records can be sorted by ID or by name.
Electricity bills are calculated automatically based on unit consumption.
**Technologies Used**

Programming Language: Java
GUI Framework: Java Swing
Data Structure: Linked List
Algorithms Used:
Bubble Sort (by ID)
Merge Sort (by Name)
Linear Search
**Data Structure Used**

A linked list is used to store customer records dynamically. Each customer works as a node containing customer details and a reference to the next node. This allows flexible data management.
**Learning Outcomes**

This project improved understanding of Java Swing.
It strengthened Object-Oriented Programming concepts.
It provided practical experience with data structures and algorithms.
It enhanced logical and problem-solving skills.
**Conclusion**

The Electricity Bill Management System is a simple and effective Java application for managing electricity billing records. It successfully demonstrates the use of Java Swing, linked lists, and basic algorithms, making it suitable for university-level projects
